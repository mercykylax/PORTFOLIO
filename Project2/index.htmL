<!-- <!-- <!-- <h1>TO THE MAN  -->
<p>Sixteen  years ago , I looked in my neighbours red, teary eyes as she told me my father had passed away.  I remember standing there and screaming.I’ll remember going to see my father in the hospital, cold and hard. I’ll remember going home, feeling empty, and not understanding why. Not understanding anything since I was little.</p>
<p>Sixteen  years later I’m sitting here thinking about my life since I lost my dad when I was eight years old.I now know in life there will be sickness,devastation,disappointments,heartache its not given the way one chooses to get through it all.Everyone always tells me I’m so strong and I’m such an inspiration. Am I really strong for losing my memory of my father as each year passes by. While part of me struggling to hold on to the image of his face, the sound of his voice, the memories I had of him  is inspiring.</p>
<p>I’m not strong or inspirational, I’m just learning. I’ve been learning what it’s like to grow up living with just my mom. I’ve been learning to appreciate the bond between me, my siblings and my mom. I’ve been learning to love my mom with everything I have, because every day I have the fear that it could be her last. Growing up in fear that God’s going to take her too. Losing a father at age eight means a life not where I’m hurting and struggling to learn to live without my dad, but rather a life where I’m struggling to hold on to his memory. I wish I could remember. I wish I knew what a life with my dad looked like. That’s what hurts the most. It’s so hard to mourn for someone you can hardly remember. It’s so hard to be comforted about the loss of your dad when you feel guilty that you hardly know what you’re for morning anymore.</p>
<p>Sixteen years of being afraid, years of listening to my friend’s stories about their dads. Ten years full of boyfriends, learning to be self driven, graduating, going to college moving on. Sixteen years of milestones without my father.</p>
<p>Please understand that this isn’t a broken story. This is a story of growth. While it was sixteen years of pain and struggling, it was 16 years full of love from my family and friends.  Years of trying to let people know that you care about them and  appreciating the people in my life and not taking them for granted.sixteen years of being thankful for the years that I did get to know my dad and of striving to be like my father.
</p>
<p>I sit in our living room at the seat on the couch where he always sat and  for just a passing moment an image of him appears.I can almost feel his complete presence.I want to reach out to him  but i know that the feeling of holding his hand is not a possibility for the rest of my lifetime.</p>

<p>It is disheartening to know that he will not be there to watch me graduate and I will have to watch my friend’s taking  photos with their dads.As morbid as it sounds after sixteen years I was able to find positives in losing  him.I was handed this challenge that made me in touch with my emotions and made me the most loving version of myself.My mom and siblings have become my best friends and I know that there would be nothing that would make you happier than to know how much we love one another.</p>
<p>I only had him for a short time,but it was enough time to teach me these lessons;I should be good to everyone whom i cross paths with because everything always comes back full circle.I also know that trust and respect should never to be earned,but given to everyone until they give you a reason not to.I know that family is the most important thing in my life even when they piss me off they will still be there at the end of the day.</p>
<p>From losing him I know that I am strong enough to cry.I am strong enough to look at the positives that come out of the bad things that happen in my life.I am strong enough to admit when I am wrong and even stronger to fight for when I am right .Most importantly I am strong enough to  wear the loss of you on my sleeve with pride.I am not afraid of sharing my story and letting people know that you alongside with mom made me who I am today.This helps me keep your memory alive.</p>
<p>Finally dad I am jealous of the way you are happy without me.May your soul rest in peace.You will always be in my mind the only man i ever fell in love with. Love you dad my number one.</p>
