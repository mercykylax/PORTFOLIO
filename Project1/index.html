<br>Motherhood.The role of a woman was to bear children.Adwoa tells Efia that her coupling with James about bearing children or she would be taken back home  if she  didnt got pregnant.Today couples who are unable to get a child of their own opt to adopt.</br>

<br>A girl is not allowed to choose her husband instead the parents choose.This is clear  from Cobbeâ€™s family where Cobbe chooses Abeeku for Effia.Later Baaba chooses James for Effia though it was against her  will.Today girls are allowed to choose the man they love.</br>
<br>Fertility in a woman was greatly valued. As Abeeku would not marry Effia  when she had not started her menstruation.Thats why she agrees  Effia to be married by the white man.</br>

<p>Women are seen as inferior and are assaulted for no reason.Big man beats up  Little dove  for no reason inorder to maintain his macho image  not be mistaken for weakling.Today  househelps are not mistreated as they have their rights.</p>

<p>Effia and Esi both deal with forms of social and physical traumas.Effia was beaten and abused by Baaba almost daily leaving her with not only physical scars but importantly emotional scars .Esi is also deprived off her dignity  by being raped.</p>
